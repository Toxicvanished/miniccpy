# Miniccpy:

Miniccpy is a small, general spin-orbital coupled-cluster (CC) package written in Python that implements
the several ground-state single-reference CC and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC approximations, in addition
to some of the particle nonconserving EOMCC approximations of the electron attachment (EA) and ionization 
potential (IP) types. Miniccpy serves as a freely available demonstration for how to program CC/EOMCC 
methodologies in Python using Numpy, and it is a useful sandbox for exploring the development and implementation
of new methodologies. However, due to its generic spin-orbital nature, it can, in principle, also be used to 
perform fully relativistic calculations for electronic, or even nuclear, structure.

A current list of available computational options includes:

### Ground-state CC methodologies
- CCD
- CCSD
- CC3
- CCSDT
- CCSDTQ
### Excited-state EOMCC methodologies 
- EOMCCSD
- EOM-CC3
- EOMCCSDT
- IP-EOMCC(2h-1p)
- IP-EOMCC(3h-2p)
- EA-EOMCC(2p-1h)
- EA-EOMCC(3p-2h)

Miniccpy only deals with the correlated CC computation and uses interfaces to PySCF or GAMESS under the hood
to obtain the starting Hartree-Fock solution and the associated one- and two-body molecular orbital integrals.
